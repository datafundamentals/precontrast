        <h1>PreContrast</h1>
        <p>PreContrast is a javascript UI only. It is a fork of PolyRest code, adapted to add the howto-ish stuff for PreContrast.</p>
        <p>This is not to be confused with the rest of the demo, which is layed out in the how to section. </p>
        <p>None of the CRUD code is specific to the tables shown, it is just generic CRUD code that walks a HATEOAS REST API<br>If you want to see more about PolyRest go <a

        <h2>Where is this deployed?</h2>
        <p>Public PreContrast deployment is in two places</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The JavaScript UI is deployed on Apache at Dreamhost.</li>
            <li>The back end REST API is running on Rackspace Carina, a Docker Swarm service.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What is the primary technology used?</h2>
        <p>Three primary technologies are used for the public facing tech, and a fourth for the demo code.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The UI is client side JS written inside Polymer.</li>
            <li>The REST API is written in Spring Data JPA, inside Spring Boot</li>
            <li>The back end is deployed inside Docker using a CoreOS container</li>
            <li>The demo version of this app is to be deployed inside a Vagrant instance, using all of above.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why this choice of technologies</h2>
        <p>Expedience is the primary motivator for choosing each of the technologies</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spring Data and Spring Boot make the REST stuff super fast and easy.</li>
            <li>PolyRest is already complete, and was a snap to fork and adapt.</li>
            <li>Docker code is much faster and easier to write than Chef code, and has other benefits - too many to mention here.</li>
            <li>Docker runs free right now on Carina which gives me a nice public facing demo.</li>
            <li>My dreamhost setup (apache, not nginx) also runs at no extra charge giving me a public facing demo.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In a real world scenario there are many other factors that would dictate other technology.
            I am comfortable with Chef code, for instance. But much discussion and practicalities
            usually precede any real world decision of this type, obviously.</p>
