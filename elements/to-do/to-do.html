        <h1>PreContrast</h1>
        <p>PreContrast is a fork of PolyRest code, adapted to add additional functionality.</p>

        <p>None of the CRUD code is specific to the tables shown, it is just generic CRUD code that walks a HATEOAS REST API</p>
        <p>If you want to see more about PolyRest go <a
                href="http://polyrest.datafundamentals.com/">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Where is this deployed?</h2>
        <p>Public PreContrast deployment is in two places</p>
        <li>
            <ul>The JavaScript UI is deployed on Apache at Dreamhost.</ul>
            <ul>The back end REST API is running on Rackspace Carina, a Docker Swarm service.</ul>
        </li>
        <h2>What is the primary technology used?</h2>
        <p>Three primary technologies are used for the public facing tech, and a fourth for the demo code.</p>
        <li>
            <ul>The UI is client side JS written inside Polymer.</ul>
            <ul>The REST API is written in Spring Data JPA, inside Spring Boot</ul>
            <ul>The back end is deployed inside Docker using a CoreOS container</ul>
            <ul>The demo version of this app is to be deployed inside a Vagrant instance, using all of above.</ul>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>

        </p>
        <p>The code for this app is <a
                href="https://github.com/datafundamentals/polyrest">here</a> If
            nothing else,
            you can use some of the code as sample Polymer code for starting your own app.
            The author is a javascript novice, so the code that you find will be very basic.</p>

        <p>PolyRest is a technical proof of concept ONLY, and not intended as production code in it's
            current (or future?) form.</p>
        <h4>Please! Do not hold Polymer responsible for...</h4>

        <p>...for the poor execution of visuals
            on this technical POC. Polymer has great visual capabilities, the author of this POC does not. :(</p>

        <h2>Pairing with Spring Data Rest and Spring Boot - back end option:</h2>

        <p>Need your own data feed? Spend a day and knock out a big, pre-populated REST API set, like the <a
                href="http://172.99.79.10:8156/">12 REST API samples</a>
            or, the code <a
                    href="https://bitbucket.org/datafundamentals/smoslt.data">here</a>. Yes, a day should be sufficient,
            once
            you learn that system. It's pretty easy, at least if you are a <em>[yawn]</em> conventional corporate java
            developer.</p>

        <p>Then use this tool for basic CRUD operations on your new API</p>

        <p>You now have working CRUD for your basic data set, and you still haven't made a dent in your development
            budget!
            Yeah! Focus your efforts on the value-adds that really matter, not just getting the basic CRUD
            operations working.</p>

        <h1>TO DO:</h1>

        <p>The TO DO list is shown below, as if there was an intent to complete it. Any assumption that this is the
            case,
            and that <em>'someone'</em> actually intends to do so, may be purely imaginary.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search isn't coded. You can pull up the input box, but nothing happens when you search.</li>
            <li>Add toggle on-off button to jsonString</li>
            <li>Need more REST APIs to call from than just this one</li>
            <li>Need to test with other apis that this was not designed for - more as a curiosity.</li>
            <li>Need to go back and write tests for everything done so far</li>
            <li>Add an incoming page for inputting the base url, instead of just hardcoding to one, or typing in the
                browser
                url.
            </li>
            <li>Test off-line to see what does and does not work? 12th of never, because requires https for the data
                feeds.
            </li>
            <li>There is some super-cludgy form handling code in upsert that has no doubt
                been written better in other frameworks, and needs to be brought in by someone more expert and familiar
                with it.
            </li>
            <li>Hardcoded to add http:/ if given none, what if needs to add https?</li>
            <li>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anything like css, or prettying up this app for visual features, is not even contemplated. Pull requests
            welcome, if anything bugs you, suc as to have the visuals suck</p>
